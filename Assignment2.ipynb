How do you write them?\nBoolean type is one of the built-in data types provided by Python, which represents one of the two values i.e. True or False. Generally, it is used to represent the truth values of the expressions. \nFor example, 1==1 is True whereas 2==3 is False."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"2.
